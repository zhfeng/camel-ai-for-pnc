== Smoke/Acceptance Test Process

=== Marete
MaReTe tests are not considered blocker for the handover and are not to be considered as acceptance tests from QE.

Tests include:

_[default]_

* Licenses check
* Productized artifacts check
* Duplicate artifacts check

MaReTe testsuite is run on several phases of the product life cycle:

* Prod team runs MaReTe [default] after each build is handed over to QE.
* QE team runs MaReTe tests [default + QE specific] for each build
* QE team runs  MaReTe tests [default + QE specific] for Quarkus Platform

==== Best Practices

* Prod team reports bugs
* *Duplicate or non productized artifacts* - would be good to report separate issues for each library
* *Licensing* - if licensing issues are coming from upstream an upstream ticket will be opened
* *Duplicate artifacts* - parents poms are not blocker for the build. Those can be whitelisted. A comment is required on the related jira about next plans (fix, wonâ€™t fix, etc)
