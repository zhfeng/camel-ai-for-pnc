= CQ tooling, a.k.a. `org.l2x6.cq:cq-*maven-plugin`

The https://github.com/l2x6/cq-maven-plugin repository hosts several Camel Quarkus community and product related Maven plugins.

While moving the product related ones under the jboss-fuse organization, groupId and Java package would be worthwhile from the maintenance and team-member access point of view, it is not easy to do because:

* The product related plugins have some dependencies on other community related modules in the same git repository
* The community related modules cannot be moved to jboss-fuse because we want to keep them vendor neutral for Camel community

This is not to say that splitting the product and community part is not possible.
It most probably is possible, but some effort needs to be spent to do it.
And also, after the split, there will be a bit more overhead due to releasing two Maven projects instead of one.
