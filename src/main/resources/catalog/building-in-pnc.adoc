== Build a new version of an artifact in PNC

Building an artifact that was built in the past is easier that starting from scratch.
Let's explain how to do that on the example of building Quarkiverse CXF 1.5.9 based on the older version 1.5.8:

* Go to https://orch.psi.redhat.com/pnc-web/#/artifacts[PNC / Artifacts]
* Search for an artifact belonging to the project, such as `quarkus-cxf-bom`
* Find the newest version, which is `io.quarkiverse.cxf:quarkus-cxf-bom:pom:1.5.8.redhat-00001` in our case.
* Click the link in the `Identifier` column which will lead you to the https://orch.psi.redhat.com/pnc-web/#/artifacts/9433762[Artifact page of quarkus-cxf-bom:pom:1.5.8.redhat-00001]
* Click the https://orch.psi.redhat.com/pnc-web/#/projects/1267/build-configs/8993/builds/AVRCWUSXK3YAA[build link] on the Artifact page
* On the Build page, go one level up in the breadcrumb bar - in our case the link is called https://orch.psi.redhat.com/pnc-web/#/projects/1267/build-configs/8993[quarkus-cxf-1.5.8]
* On the quarkus-cxf-1.5.8 build config page, click the `Clone` button.
* A copy with some random name will be created. Click the `Edit` button and change what's needed, most notably
** Change the name to `quarkus-cxf-1.5.9`
** Change the upstream tag to `1.5.9`
* Once done with editing, click the `Build` button
