= Fixing issues

== Upstream first!

This is the rule #1 of sustaining engineering.
Product issues are fixed on the community `main` branch first.
Afterwards they have to be backported to all relevant active upstream and downstream branches.

The reason for this policy is, that customers must always have a regression-free upgrade path.

=== Which branches are active?

For product, those are branches within the support or maintenance window - i.e. branches from which customers are still getting new patch releases.

For upstream, those are all LTS (Long Term Support) branches within their support window.

=== Which branches are relevant for the given fix?

It depends for which product release/build the given issue was reported.
Again, customers must always have a regression-free upgrade path.
Hence the fix must go to the branch where the issue was reported and all newer active branches.

E.g. if the issue was reported for, CEQ 2.7.1, then it has to be fixed on

* Any active `camel-quarkus-2.7.m-product` (where m > 1) branches as long as they exist
* Any active `camel-quarkus-2.n.*-product` (where n > 7) branches as long as they exist
* The `2.7.x` LTS branch in upstream
* Any active `2.n.x` LTS branch in upstream if they exist
* Upstream `main` branch

== Issue Trackers

=== Downstream

* https://issues.redhat.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=4936[Fuse Release Overview] - the most important Kanban board
** https://issues.redhat.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=4936&quickFilter=49222[Fuse Release Overview with CQ filter] - even more important for engineers working on Camel Quarkus
** You may also want to use milestone filters like 2021-M3

=== Upstream

* https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues[https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues]

== Linking issues between product and community

* References (links, mentions, ...) to Red Hat products in the community issue tracker and in community pull requests (PRs) is generally unwanted. Community should stay vendor neutral.
* Take care that your upstream commits reference the upstream issue. Example:
+
[source]
----
Stop testing JavaScript DSL in native mode #2481
----
+
Where #2481 is the number of the upstream issue https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/2481[https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/2481]

* Any mapping/referencing between upstream and downstream may happen only on the product side.
** The common practice is to add a community issue link (such as https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/2492 ) to the description of the Jira issue, see e.g. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENTESB-16238[ENTESB-16238]
** One downstream issue may contain references to multiple downstream issues.
* So that we do not lose track of which community issues need our (engineering) attention (because they are product issues), we assign https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/milestones[milestones] to them.
