= RHBQ platform productization

== Git repositories

* Upstream: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-platform
* Midstream: RHBQ and RHBQ Platform have no midstream repository
* Product: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/pnc-workspace/quarkusio/quarkus-platform (since 2024-05-03)
  the old https://code.engineering.redhat.com/gerrit/admin/repos/quarkusio/[Gerrit repo] is read-only nowquarkus-platform

== Preparations

As a first step, please add an ssh public key to GitLab.
Go to your GitLab Preferences / https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/-/profile/keys[SSH Keys] and add your ssh public key including algorithm and mail address, for instance:

[source,shell]
---
ssh-rsa xxx_public_key== user@host
---

Then create a fork using GitLab UI

Do not forget to change the name of the organization to your Kerberos username:

After that, clone the quarkus-platform downstream project and add your fork as a remote, like below:

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone git@gitlab.cee.redhat.com:pnc-workspace/quarkusio/quarkus-platform.git -o downstream
$ cd quarkus-platform
$ git remote add ${USER} git@gitlab.cee.redhat.com:${USER}/quarkus-platform.git
----

== Productization

You may want to read Paul Gallagher's https://docs.google.com/document/d/1INiaJ2j80aUSHGTTihbmXxMCHsQXur7tDZykyp8HZvY/edit[Quarkus platform integration build process] - this one is quite detailed but not always up to date.

There is also https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/quarkus-platform/process-documentation[quarkus-platform/process-documentation] on GitLab.
As as of writing this, it is far from complete.

TIP: Notify https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04J4CJ5Q0H[Quarkus Prod team] any time you do not find some information in their docs.

To add/upgrade CEQ in RHBQ Platform, you need to create a GitLab merge request.

Now it is possible to spin a platform build ourself:
