= Camel Quarkus productization

== Git repositories

* Upstream: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus
* Midstream: https://github.com/jboss-fuse/camel-quarkus
* Product: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/pnc-workspace/jboss-fuse/camel-quarkus (since 2024-05-03)
  the old https://code.engineering.redhat.com/gerrit/admin/repos/jboss-fuse/camel-quarkus[Gerrit repo] is read-only now

Check xref:maven-repositories.adoc[Maven repositories] before you continue.

== Midstream branch

We always have a separate branch for every micro release:

* `camel-quarkus-2.2.0-product`
* `camel-quarkus-2.2.1-product`
* etc.

Those branches should be based on their corresponding upstream releases (although this wasnâ€™t always the case with the first releases).

To create a new branch based on the community tag, do something like

[source,shell]
----
export UPSTREAM_TAG=2.7.2
git fetch upstream $UPSTREAM_TAG
git tag $UPSTREAM_TAG FETCH_HEAD
git checkout -b camel-quarkus-$UPSTREAM_TAG-product $UPSTREAM_TAG
----

=== First commit

After creating the new midstream branch a few initial commits are needed to prepare the source tree for the product.

The first commit can be prepared using `cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-init` mojo (see also xref:cq-tooling.adoc[CQ tooling]).
It adds a few properties in the root `pom.xml`, adds some plugins and copies some files from the previous prod branch.

Check the latest version of the mojo on the https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/l2x6/cq/cq-prod-maven-plugin/[Central] and adapt the script below if needed:

[source,shell]
----
$ CQ_VERSION=3.1.1
$ CAMEL_SAP_VERSION=4.0.0.redhat-00069
$ PREVIOUS_PROD_BRANCH=camel-quarkus-2.7.1-product
$ mvn org.l2x6.cq:cq-prod-maven-plugin:$CQ_VERSION:prod-init -Dcq.fromBranch=$PREVIOUS_PROD_BRANCH -Dcamel-sap.version=$CAMEL_SAP_VERSION -N -e
----

You may want to compare the resulting state with the previous prod branch.
If something important is missing, you may want to add an edit step in the `prod-init` mojo.

Otherwise, you can commit the changes:

[source,shell]
----
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initialize $UPSTREAM_TAG product branch"
----

=== Adjust `camel-quarkus-product-source.json`

Among other files, the `prod-init` mojo adds `product/src/main/resources/camel-quarkus-product-source.json` file.
This file generally requires some tweaks, like

* Adding extensions newly supported in the upcoming product release
* Changing support levels
* Adding new Quarkus CXF extensions to `additionalProductizedArtifacts`.
  As of CEQ 3.8.0, all Quarkus CXF extensions are supported
  and thus all `io.quarkiverse.cxf:*` extensions available in `product/src/main/generated/transitive-dependencies-all.txt`
  should be listed in `additionalProductizedArtifacts`.
* etc.

Consult `product/README.adoc` for more details about `camel-quarkus-product-source.json`.

=== Unlink unneeded modules (a.k.a. partial productization)

When you are done with editing `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` you can go on to adapting the source tree to those changes.

This is done using `cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-excludes` mojo.
It transforms the source tree in such a way that only Maven modules required by the CEQ extensions defined in `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` are kept linked in the tree.
The rest of the modules is "unlinked" from the source tree by commenting their respective `<modules>` in `pom.xml` files.

The way how to run and configure the mojo is described in `product/README.adoc` of the given midstream branch.

[source,shell]
----
mvn org.l2x6.cq:cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-excludes -N -e
----

=== Testing

The `prod-excludes` mojo also packs integration test modules into two levels of groups under `https://github.com/jboss-fuse/camel-quarkus/tree/camel-quarkus-2.7.1-product/product[product]` directory:

1. Based on whether the given test covers supported extension(s), and whether the covered extensions are supported in native mode. The kinds are as follows:
+
* `product` - only supported extensions covered
* `mixed` - covers a productized extension, but some unsupported extensions are required for the sake of testing
* `native` - unsupported (in CEQ product) extensions that support native mode
* `jvm-only` - unsupported (in CEQ product) extensions that do not support native mode
+
2. Groups of tests to allow parallel execution on multiple Jenkins nodes.

These groups are honored by the Jenkins job attached to the midstream repository.

== PNC

* Build configs: https://orch.psi.redhat.com/pnc-web/#/projects/788
* PME scripts: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/fuse-prod/pme-manipulators/-/tree/main/src/main/groovy/com/redhat/fuse/groovy
* CPaaS pipeline: https://jenkins-cpaas-camel-quarkus.apps.cpaas-poc.r6c9.p1.openshiftapps.com/job/main/job/camel-quarkus/job/camel-quarkus/job/camel-quarkus/

=== PiG Build Config

The build configs for CEQ are stored within a Git repository here:

https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/fuse-prod/build-configurations

After a new product branch has been created, fork & clone the above project and create a directory for the new product release. The simplest approach is to
copy and rename the directory from the last release.

[source,shell]
----
cd camel-quarkus
cp -r camel-quarkus-2.13.0 camel-quarkus-2.13.1
----

Next, customize `build-config.yaml` for the new product release. Placeholder variables declared at the top of the file will need modifying.

`#!quarkusVersion` should be set to the productized Quarkus version that CEQ is aligned with.

`#!quarkusCxfVersion` should be set to the base version of quarkus-cxf being productized for CEQ.

`#!milestoneVersion` should be set to `CQ1` if this is the first build of the new CEQ product release. Otherwise the number can be incremented whenever a build is due to be handed over to QE.

`#!ceqVersion` should be set to the base version of CEQ being productized.

When complete, commit the changes and create a merge request.

It's also a good idea to have write access to the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/fuse-prod/build-configurations[build-configurations] project.
You can click the `Request Access` link on the GitLab https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/fuse-prod/build-configurations[build-configurations] project page and someone will grant you access.

=== CPaaS Pipeline Config

The CPaaS Pipeline config for CEQ is stored within a Git repository here:

https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/cpaas-products/camel-quarkus/

After creating a build config for the new CEQ product release, you can proceed to set up the CPaaS build pipeline.

First click the `Request Access` link on the GitLab `cpaas-products/camel-quarkus` https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/cpaas-products/camel-quarkus/[project page]. Once access is granted, create a new branch for the product release. The simplest
approach is to copy the content from the previous release branch. You can do this from the GitLab UI via the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/cpaas-products/camel-quarkus/-/branches/new[New Branch] option.

With the new branch created, you can fork and clone `cpaas-products/camel-quarkus` and start making customizations. Edit `product.yml` and update the release version.
Also update the `pig-source` `root` configuration to point at the correct PiG configuration directory. `release.yml` can be left unmodified.

Commit the changes and create a merge request.

After the changes are merged, make sure your username is available in the list of `admins` in the CPaaS onboarding configuration of Camel Quarkus:
https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/cpaas-products/product-configs/-/blob/main/camel-quarkus/camel-quarkus.yml#L5

Once you were added to admins,
you can run the https://jenkins-cpaas-camel-quarkus.apps.cpaas-poc.r6c9.p1.openshiftapps.com/job/pipeline-seed/[Jenkins pipeline seed] job.
The release version should eventually show up on the https://jenkins-cpaas-camel-quarkus.apps.cpaas-poc.r6c9.p1.openshiftapps.com/[Jenkins dashboard].

Within each version folder there is a `build-pipeline` job from where you can trigger the CEQ pipeline (via `Build with Parameters`):

image::cpaas-cq-build-pipeline-run-with-parameters.png[CPaaS Camel Quarkus job - Build with Parameters]

Parameters:

* `force` - if enabled, a new PNC build will be performed even if there are no changes in the associated PNC build configs;
  otherwise the PNC build will be triggered only if there is no build yet for the given state of the build config.
* `scratch` - if enabled, just a temporary build is triggered in PNC; otherwise a permanent build is triggered
* `product_config_dir` - leave empty, because our `release.yaml` is in the root folder of our https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/cpaas-products/camel-quarkus/[CPaaS config]
* `msg_properties` - leave empty. FIXME: what is this actually for?

When the whole pipeline runs successfully, the releases product will be available at:

* https://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rcm-guest/staging/integration/ (for permanent build)
* https://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rcm-guest/staging/integration/scratch (for temporary build)

== Camel Quarkus "internal" zipped Maven repository

The above CPaaS job outputs a xref:glossary.adoc#_mrrc_zip_zipped_maven_repo[Zipped Maven repository] suitable for running xref:glossary.adoc#_marete[Marete] tests.

While this "internal" zipped Maven repository (as opposed to xref:productization/zipped-maven-repository.adoc[RHBQ Platform zipped Maven repository])
is not a final deliverable for handing over to CEQ QE, it is still handy for the following use cases:

* Early xref:productization/marete.adoc[Marete] testing (and fixing uncovered issues)
* Comparing against RHBQ core zipped Maven repository
* other similar verifications

Note that the "internal" Maven repo is much faster to produce than the proper RHBQ Platform zipped Maven repository,
which typically takes 2+ days when delivered by Quarkus Prod team.

[#marete-internal]
=== Running Marete against CEQ "internal" zipped Maven repository

==== `camel-quarkus-marete-test` Jenkins job

When a build is completed and the deliverables are available in the https://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rcm-guest/staging/integration/[RCM staging area], a Jenkins job can be run to execute Marete tests against them.

https://fuse-next-jenkins-csb-fuse-qe.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/view/Camel%20Quarkus/job/camel-quarkus/job/3.8/job/marete-cq/

Click 'Build with Parameters` and provide the necessary links to each of the build deliverables in the https://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rcm-guest/staging/integration/[RCM staging area].

The build takes around 5 minutes to complete. When finished you can browse the build console log to review failures. Or look at the test result summary.

==== Local Marete testing

If desired, you can also run Marete locally. This script works as of CEQ 2.13.2.CQ6:

[source,shell]
